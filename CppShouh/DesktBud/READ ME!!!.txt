Ok, I got your attention.

I'll go straight to the point.
You can customize the program anyway you want as long as it is not plagaraizing the program.
If you edit the files from this folder and subfolder(s), it is your responsibility if any problem arises.
Now, go out there and have fun with the app and boast with skrubs that your picture is the best among your skrubs.

Btw, no signature here and there might be or not for next patch depending on my mood.
